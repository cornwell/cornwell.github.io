`\begin{summer}` 
---

A few days ago, I finished what turned out to be a tough semester. This summer I'll be ramping back up a couple of research projects that got set aside in the early part of the year and working on home projects that are long overdue! 

**Research projects.** (1) Understanding statistics of Functional dimension for ReLU feedforward neural networks, particularly how it is influenced by depth and width of the network;  (2) New analysis techniques for studying landmark data on avian hyoid structures, in particular using the Euler Characteristic Transform on the 3D shape data.

**Ugrad projects.** The REU ended last summer and we haven't renewed it (like there was a chance in this particular environment anyway!). I'm mentoring an undergrad over the summer on some questions on hyperbolic and elliptic geometry in 2D &ndash; _kind of a reading course, kind of research_. 

**New admin stuff.** I'll be sorting out :boom: in order to be on top of my new position &ndash; director of the masters of applied math at TU.

**Coding.** It seems I cannot keep myself from overloading... I am **setting myself a 100-day coding challenge**. Time period: today &mdash; sept.03 (inclusive). The coding that I'll do each day will be on different ideas and topics; will often only have time for 1 or 2 hours. Some of it will synergize(:unamused:) with improving the way I do Math 371 in the fall.
