New to TU, the course **MATH 371: Introduction to Machine Learning** will run for the first time in Spring 2025, and I will be inaugural professor for this course!  See the course description and other details below. 

Have you wanted to apply math from your courses, with a bit of coding, and be able to make a script that "learns" how to answer questions about data coming from the real-world? In Introduction to Machine Learning you will learn some of the basics for doing just that.

#### Course Description

An introduction to the theory and implementation of machine learning. Linear methods in regression and classification; feature mapping; kernels; overfitting; model selection. Additional topics may include support vector machines or unsupervised learning. Course design integrates coding, algorithmic implementation, and mathematical theory.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 265 and MATH 274; MATH 331 (may be taken concurrently).

#### Computational Data Science Track

If you are in the Computer and Mathematical Sciences Major, then MATH 371 fulfills a requirement for the Computational Data Science track! See the [requirements](https://catalog.towson.edu/undergraduate/fisher-science-mathematics/computer-information-sciences/computer-and-mathematical-sciences/index.html#requirementstext) (scroll down).

Any questions? Stop by my office in the math building or send me an email. I'll be happy to discuss it with you!
