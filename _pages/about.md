Me: I love math, science, games, art &ndash; _voyaging through strange seas of thought_.

## research interests
**Machine learning and geometry &amp; topology.** In the area of machine learning, I have recently focused on the mathematical structure of ReLU neural networks. In geometry and topology, I focus on _low-dimensional topology_, particularly knot theory in 3-manifolds, and interactions with contact geometry.

## teaching
I teach a large variety of classes for the math department at TU, often a calculus course and a course for majors. 

**Spring 2025:** Math 273 (Calculus I) and Math 371 (Intro to Machine Learning).
