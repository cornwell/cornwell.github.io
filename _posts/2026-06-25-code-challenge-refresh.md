From June 25 to Oct 02, 2025 (inclusive).

I'm pressing refresh on my coding challenge. It's not that I haven't coded since the end of the last log (June 2), but I needed a break on some days &ndash; I was writing with deadlines.

This time, I've some valuable ground rules. First, the following things count: writing comments in code, image generation for posts and manuscripts, and also, any testing-with-code of a mathematical idea. Second, don't be hard on yourself. If you don't have time to do more than 5-10 minutes worth, then do that. Test an idea, or just do some Project Euler or Leetcode challenge problem.
