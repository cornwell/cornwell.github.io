It's almost a new year and the time has come for a revamp of my website! For a while, I have wanted the versatility of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based GitHub pages website, but I hadn't taken the time to get it started. Well, I found this [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) in a list of popular Jekyll themes. I like the look of it.  Hopefully it will make it easy to integrate elements of research and teaching. 

<mark>Posts from a date previous to this one are sample posts that were created by the al-folio theme contributors.</mark>

### Previous webpage
For a few years, I maintained a [Wordpress webpage](https://wp.towson.edu/ccornwell/) and blog where I posted about both research and teaching. I haven't posted to that in a while, though (1 post in the last 3 years?). I'm hoping to stay motivated in this new venue, especially since it should be easier to put together _thoughts and discussion_ with _code and experiment_. Let's say that keeping up the site is a New Year's resolution! :oncoming_bus: :eyes:

**Added bonus:** I plan for the new machine learning courses I'll be teaching (Math 371 and 471) to have some GitHub presence; this site should help with that.<br>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:square"> There are some teaching-focused blog posts on the Wordpress site that I would rather not rewrite. We'll see how it goes, linking to them from here.
    </li>
</ul>

### Research and Teaching
**Research.** I imagine that most of my updates to the site on the research end will be blogging (just thoughts, as well as research progress) and posting support scripts, or custom packages, that I made to help me with research. I'll also post about publications and preprints, etc.

**Teaching.** Let's start with small goals here, so it doesn't soak up too much of my time. I plan to make a repo on GitHub for Math 371 -- at some point that will appear under the repositories tab -- as well as some info for students under the teaching tab. Other classes might follow, particularly Math 471.
